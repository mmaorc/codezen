# CodeZen

## Description

CodeZen is your indispensable partner in programming. It is a CLI utility that uses LLMs to help you debug and evolve your codebase based on your requests.

The differences from Github Copilot:
* This is a CLI tool, meaning it can be used regardless of your chosen IDE.
* This provides the LLM with the entire codebase, so it can do things that require a more wholistic view of your project.

Current limitations:
* Only Work for small codebases- currently we send the entire codebase in each request. ðŸ˜†
* It can't change files autonomously, it only offers a solution.
* It uses hard coded direcory names to know which files to ignore. Currently it only contains Python and Node.js common ignorable directories.
